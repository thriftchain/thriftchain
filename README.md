Description


Overview

ThriftChain, a Blockchain Contribution and Thrift Web Application, is a cutting-edge financial management tool that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate individual and group-based saving, contribution, and thrift activities. i.e. it allows individuals and groups to save and contribute towards targeted goals.
The product allows users to contribute in stable coins (Toro-NGN) or any other stablecoin of users' choice) and select their saving frequency while defining their financial goals, be it for personal objectives or for communal assets. Users can contribute regularly at various frequencies (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) and receive their targeted goals upon maturity, thus fostering a culture of disciplined and goal-oriented financial planning.

ThriftChain provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way for users to save, contribute, and work towards achieving financial and lifestyle goals.

Problem Statement

Many individuals and groups struggle to save money or collectively contribute towards shared financial goals effectively. They face challenges in collectively acquiring assets due to various logistical, financial, and trust-related issues. 
The absence of a transparent, secure, and user-friendly platform often hinders the ability to combine both individual and group savings in a seamless manner which result in inefficient achievement of collective ownership goals. 
Additionally, there is a need for a platform that enables the acquisition and management of various assets through collective contributions as lack of diverse asset options such as (real estate properties, household appliances, vehicles, equipment, investment share, educational resources, consumables, arts and collectibles, digital assets, SDGs charitable contributions etc) and inflexible ownership models restricts the participation and engagement of potential contributors, impeding the realization of shared ownership aspirations.

Target Audience:

Individual Savers: Individuals looking for a reliable platform to save money for specific goals and earn interest on their savings.
Group Savers: Communities, organizations, or friends with shared financial objectives, such as purchasing assets collectively or achieving specific targets.

Product Objectives:

To promote financial discipline encouraging users to cultivate regular saving habits.
To facilitate community savings, enabling users to pool resources for collective financial goals
Enable users to save towards specific goals, including individual and group savings.
Promote trust and transparency through blockchain technology
